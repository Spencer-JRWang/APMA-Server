![APMA](Figure/APMA.png)
The AMPA is intended to calculate the features of protein mutation including Amino Acid Web features
such as Betweenness Closeness etc. and other features like Effectiveness, Stiffness and Entropy, Co.evolution.

Also, a stacking model is built automatically to detect the best model to classify the categories you provide.

It can also give you basic figures
